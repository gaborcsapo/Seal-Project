# Seal-Project - Visualizing Multivariate Ocean Data with Multiple Views
Approached the Center for Sea Level Change looking for project ideas for a class. The head of CSLC asked for help to create a visual analysis system for salinity, depth, temperature data collected by tags put on seals in two fjords in Greenland. The project will help scientists better understand fjords and the melting of glaciers through novel visualization techniques for the temporal and spatial aspects of CTD data. I built the visualization using D3 JS.
